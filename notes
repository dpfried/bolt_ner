Incremental introduction of objects, that we already had physical information about.

Average of 29 responses per scene.

Widely varying quality of responses (show examples)

Two different approaches:
    build classifiers for objects, within a scene, based on knowledge of which object is new

    build classifiers for features (shape and color), based on knowledge of the objects' features

Bag of words classification using NBCs, maximum a posteriori, and add-one
smoothing.

Noun-phrase-in-subject isolation as a substitute for semiotics. Using TRIPS and
parse tree pruning

Building a goldstandard for proofing (not used to train classifier in any way).

Results on object classification. Present k-fold cross validation overall (87%
accuracy), and with learning curves.

Results on feature classification. Present k-fold cross validation overall (86%
for color, 90% for shape), and with learning curves.

When a larger training set is available (e.g. when training features, not
objects), have had good results even with more inclusive feature extraction.
All innermost noun phrases, and even all words (not using the parse tree at
all). Show these results.

Possible reasons for color confusion: different monitor temperatures. Cyan had
lowest accuracy, and we know humans have trouble telling cyan and blue apart.
